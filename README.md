1. Each student may be given a copy of the appropriate zip file for the relevant lab. The executables are directly created from the source code as found in the mirroring zip file. All code is runnable directly from idle.
   
2. Create a folder in each lab folder for each student in the format firstname_lastname. When downloading student_submissions, download each student into the appropriate folder.

3. When grading all submissions, run test_all_submissions from idle. The program will disperse all necessary documents to all student folders.
