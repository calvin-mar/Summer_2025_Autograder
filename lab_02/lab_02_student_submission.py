# 1 Temperature Conversion


# Have the user enter a floating point number in degrees Celsius into the
# variable f_celsius.  Convert the temperature to degrees Fahrenheit, save the
# result in the variable f_temp_fahr, and print it out.  Note that
# Fahrenheit = (9/5) * Celsius + 32.


# 2 Distance Conversion


# Have the user enter a floating point number representing the number of miles
# they ran into the variable f_miles.  Convert the number of miles to kilometers,
# save the result in the variable f_distance_km, and print out the result.  Note
# that 5 kilometers is equal to 3.1 miles.


# 3 Pizza Calculator


# A pizzeria sells round pizzas with the following specifications:
# small: 12 inch diameter for $8
# medium: 16 inch diameter for $12
# large: 18 inch diameter for $16

# Write a program that calculates the area of each size of pizza and stores the
# results in the variables f_small_area, f_med_area, and f_large_area.  Print out
# the results.  The area of a circle is pi * the square of the radius.  Use 3.14
# for pi.

# Also, have your program calculate the cost per square inch of each pizza size,
# store the results in f_small_cost, f_med_cost, and f_large_cost, and print out
# the results.  The cost per square inch is just the price divided by the area.



# 4 Olympics Party

# You're preparing for an Olympics watching party at your house and need to buy
# food.

# Sodas come in 12-packs, rolls come in 12-packs, hot dogs in 8-packs,
# and chips come in boxes with 16 bags in a box.

# Write a program that prompts the user for the number of people coming to the
# party and stores that value in the variable i_people, and then calculates the
# number of packs of soda, packs of hot dogs, packs of rolls, and boxes
# of chips you will need so each person can have 2 sodas and eat 1 hot dog with
# a roll and a small bag of chips.  NOTE that this won't be an exact answer (you
# might need 4.2 packs of something), so add 1 to each type of item to make sure
# you have enough.  In the case mentioned, if you needed 4.2 packs, your answer
# should be 5.  Don't try to round off the numbers with some fancy Python code.
# Think about the techniques we saw today in class.

# Store your answers in the variables
# - i_roll_packs
# - i_soda_packs
# - i_hot_dog_packs
# - i_chip_boxes

# and print them out.

# Calculate and print out how many of each item will be left and store your
# answers in the variables
# - i_rem_rolls
# - i_rem_sodas
# - i_rem_hot_dogs
# - i_rem_chips
